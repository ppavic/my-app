3. Inside of that directory create python virtual environment using following line

    python -m venv <name_of_virtual_environment>

4. activate virtual environment with command:

    <name_of_virtual_environment>\Scripts\activate

5. install node environment for python:

    pip install nodeenv

6. after installation run command

    nodeenv -p

7. After instalation verify that you have installed version of npm with command:

    npm --version

8. Create node virtual environment:

    nodeenv <name_of_environment>

9. Activate new environment:
